This is my first own Unity project, made after ending Unity Learn's "Junior Programmer" course (in fact i started working on it while going through the course).
There are two builds for two platforms: Windows and Android - you can try any build by chosing one of the branches in repository on Github.
This project was made in Unity version 6000.0.29f1, but should work on oldest versions to.

Your target in the game is to get to the finish line on each of three levels, but before you get to the finish line you have to collect all the coins on the level. 
Also there is a timer on each level so you can try to end levels for minimum amount of time and then watch your results in the main menu.
